Hardware class to control spectrometer. All hardware classes require a definition of
parameter_display_dict (set Spinbox options and read/write)
set_parameter function (assign set functions)

NOTE:
Communication with Pixis is kind of slow (150ms), such that in the current interface a new image is acquired every 150ms
at the fastest. If ever a faster acquisition is required, transfer of multiple frames per communication (eg. with
cam.grab - see manual or pylablib homepage) can be implemented. For the current planned experiments an acquistion rate of
150ms was judged to be sufficient.
To install driver, picam needs to be installed on the PC. It is freely available at:
https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/pi_max4/?vertical=tvs-princeton-instruments&segment=tvs&aQ=Picam&aPage=1&dlQ=picam&dlPage=1
